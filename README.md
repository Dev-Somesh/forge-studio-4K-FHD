## ✨ Engine Features

### 💎 Precision Rendering
- **Native 4K Assets**: 3840 x 2160 pixels for pixel-perfect desktop clarity.
- **Dynamic Orientation**: Specialized layout logic for **16:9 Landscape** and **9:16 Portrait**.
- **Gemini 3 Pro Pipeline**: Access to high-tier neural cores for complex geometric synthesis.

### 🧠 Identity Matrix & Fandom
- **Character Integration**: Stylized inclusion of Anime, Superhero, or Brand identities (Logo, Symbol, Silhouette).
- **Neural Synthesis**: A Creative Director mode where the engine invents original geometric architectures.
- **Pattern Capture**: Stored library for recurring neural geometric discoveries.

### 🎨 Material Architecture
- **Surface Architect**: Apply finishes like *Frosted Glass*, *Brushed Metal*, *Neon Glow*, and *Organic Matte*.
- **Chromatic Scale**: Curated palette of solids and luminal "Abyss" gradients.
- **Temporal History**: A real-time session tray for instant asset comparison and recovery.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Core Engine**: React 19 (No-Build ESM Pattern)
- **Neural Interface**: `@google/genai` (Native Gemini SDK Integration)
- **Visual Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **Persistence Layer**: Browser LocalStorage
- **Deployment**: Netlify-optimized with environment shims for stable global access.

## 🚀 Initialization

1. **Environmental Link**: Ensure `API_KEY` is present in your hosting environment.
2. **Core Selection**: Toggle between **FHD (Fast)** and **4K (Precision)** cores.
3. **Orchestration**: Select geometry, material finish, and optional identity nodes.
4. **Synthesis**: Activate the `RUN_ENGINE` command to generate your asset.
